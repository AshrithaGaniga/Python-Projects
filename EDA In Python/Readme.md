# **Exploratory Data Analysis in Python**  

This project involves **analyzing a world population dataset** using **Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**. The goal was to explore trends across continents and over the years, uncovering key insights about population distribution and growth.  

---

## **What I Did**  

### **1. Loaded & Cleaned the Data**  
- Read the dataset from a **CSV file**:  
  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Ashritha\Downloads\world_population (3).csv")
  ```  
- Removed **duplicate rows** to ensure data quality.  
- Adjusted **display options** for better readability.  

### **2. Examined the Data**  
- Used `info()` and `describe()` to **understand data structure**.  
- Checked for **missing values** and counted unique entries.  
- **Sorted data** to identify the **top 10 countries** by **World Population Percentage**.  

### **3. Analyzed Relationships**  
- Computed **correlations** between numeric features.  
- Visualized **correlation patterns** using a **heatmap**.  

### **4. Grouped & Compared Data**  
- Grouped data by **continent** to analyze **average population trends**.  
- Plotted **population growth trends over different years**.  
- Used **boxplots** to examine the distribution of population data.  
- Created a **scatter plot** to explore the relationship between a **countryâ€™s area and its 2022 population**.

## **How to Run the Project**  

### **1. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```  

### **2. Update the File Path**  
Modify the script if needed to match your dataset location:  
```python
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Ashritha\Downloads\world_population (3).csv")
```  

### **3. Run the Code**  
Execute the script in any Python environment:  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **VS Code / PyCharm**  
- **Command Line / Terminal**

## **Final Thoughts**  

This project provided valuable experience in **data exploration and visualization**. It was fascinating to analyze **population trends, correlations, and distributions** across different regions.  

 **Further exploration could include:**  
- Predicting **future population growth** using machine learning models.  
- Investigating the **impact of population density on economic factors**.
